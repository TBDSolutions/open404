=======
The cost and utilization data reported by Michigan’s CMHs (also known as the 404 report) has potential to be a beneficial tool in improving services for the populations served by the CMHs.  Currently, this data is officially reported to the Michigan legislature, however the data is not being analyzed extensively by individuals within the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) or the CMHs themselves for decision-making purposes.  Given the current changes to Michigan’s public health system, there is increasing utility in using data to understand current service use, cost trends and inconsistencies across the state for vulnerable populations.
