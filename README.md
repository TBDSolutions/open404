=======
The cost and utilization data reported by Michigan’s CMHs (also known as the 404 report) has potential to be a beneficial tool in improving services for the populations served by the CMHs.  Currently, this data is officially reported to the Michigan legislature, however the data is not being analyzed extensively by individuals within DCH or the CMHs themselves for decision-making purposes.  Given the current changes to Michigan’s Medicaid system (e.g., moving from 18 PIHPs to 10,the expansion of Medicaid), it would stand to reason that public health officials would find utility in using data to understand current service use, cost trends and inconsistencies across the state for vulnerable populations.  With this goal in mind, we set out to compile, format, and analyze the Michigan cost and utilization reports.

Formatting
•	Compilation of individual Excel files into one master dataset
•	Creation of new variables: Fiscal Year, PIHP, Units per 1,000, and Service 
•	Standardization of unit variable to hours, such that 1.00 = 1 hour
•	Aggregation of data based on population or region
•	Creation of new datasets placing “Service” in columns instead of rows
